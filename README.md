XMasBingo
=========

A Christmas Bingo sheet maker.  There are twenty seven pictures, though a given board only uses sixteen.  The images are chosen randomly.  Refresh the page to get a random new board.  The images are all Public Domain, and so are the resulting Bingo boards.

The `html` file has style information in the top of it.  If you find that the boards are not the right size for your needs, you can make a copy of the project and then tweak the CSS until you get what you need.

The underlying code can easily be adapted to non-Christmas use.  The code here is very short and simple and, therefore, easy to modify to fit your needs.
