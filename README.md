XMasBingo
=========

A Christmas Bingo sheet maker.  There are twenty seven pictures, though a given board only uses sixteen.  The images are chosen randomly.  Refresh the page to get a random new board.  The images are all Public Domain, and so are the resulting Bingo boards.

The `html` file has style information in the top of it.  If you find that the boards are not the right size for your needs, you can make a copy of the project and then tweak the CSS until you get what you need.

The underlying code can easily be adapted to non-Christmas use.  The code here is very short and simple and, therefore, easy to modify to fit your needs.

When you're running Bingo at school or in an event, you might find the `Bingo.Key.odt` file to be a handy reference; it has all of the images and their names on one page.

The `Bingo.Flashcards.odg` file has each image on its own page.  If you print it out, you can choose the next word by randomly choosing a sheet from that stack.
