XMasBingo
=========

A Christmas Bingo sheet maker.  There are twenty seven pictures, though a given board only uses sixteen.  The images are chosen randomly.  Refresh the page to get a random new board.  The images are all Public Domain, and so are the resulting Bingo boards.

The `html` file has style information in the top of it.  If you find that the boards are not the right size for your needs, you can make a copy of the project and then tweak the CSS until you get what you need.

The underlying code can easily be adapted to non-Christmas use.  The code here is very short and simple and, therefore, easy to modify to fit your needs.

If you want to use this project, browse to <https://dperkins.org/2013/2013-12-23.XMasBingo-1.2/bingo.html>.  Alternately, download the latest release or clone the repository and browse to `bingo.html`.

When you're running Bingo at school or in an event, you might find the `Bingo.Key.odt` file to be a handy reference; it has all of the images and their names on one page.

The `Bingo.Flashcards.odg` file has each image on its own page.  If you print it out, you can choose the next word by randomly choosing a sheet from that stack.
